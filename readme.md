# NoTrack
Simple Firefox extension for escaping google's tracker.  Inspired by Undirect.

## How does this work?
Google hides redirect url before you click the link. So you could inspect the link in the bottom corner.  
### Before you click:

### after you click:

Now what NoTrack do is swap the original anchor tag with a new one without any attributes but `href`, so Google couldn't swap it.

## Installing
WIP

## Todo
- Change how the Script work:
    - instead of swaping the anchor link, it's better to disable the function instead of swapping the the anchor tag.

## Acknowledgement
Yes i know this is a futile attempt to escape google's tracker, but at the very least google can't see where are you going...for now at least.  
**Please use alternative search engines like startpage or DuckDuckGo**  
it's more secure and it respect your privacy.
  
Made this at 3AM within 20 minutes.
